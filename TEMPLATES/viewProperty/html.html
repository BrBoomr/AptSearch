    Currently have property with id: {{ property.getId() }}

    <h1>VIEW PROPERTY PAGE</h1>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>we should be able to arrive at this route from a GET request that passes the id of the property (like for recipe) [this makes the page bookmarkable]</li>
        <li>the link to this page should be generated by the MORE DETAILS button in the search page (A.K.A. homepage)</li>
        <li>if the apartment is marked as not available it should still allow you to view the property but should indicate that it isnt available</li>
        <li>this should allow you to view all the details shown in the search page but with even more details like all the tags associated with the thing and the extra info of each tag if it has any</li>
    </ol>
