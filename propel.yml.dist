# When you're part of a team, you could want to define a common configuration file and commit it into your VCS. But, of
# course, there can be some properties you don't want to share, e.g. database passwords. Propel helps you and looks for
# a propel.yml.dist file too, merging its properties with propel.yml ones. So you can define shared configuration
# properties in propel.yml.dist, committing it in your VCS, and keep propel.yml as private. The properties loaded from
# propel.yml overwrite the ones with the same name, loaded from propel.yml.dist.
